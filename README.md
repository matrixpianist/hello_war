# hello_war
Just next to the beginning.

#---------------------------------------------------
#   What is the meaning of the war? I'm just thinking about it. With the blood, with the killing, with the roar of the harridan? 
# No, I don't think so. The war is a kind of chaos. It happens from the beginning of the cosmos which we are living. If I can give 
# you a super microscope, maybe you can find the war happened in your body. Why the cancer happened? It's a good instance to prove it. 
# It's ridiculars that you think you are control your body perfectly just like you heared that the goverment is controlling the country.
# The country comes from the people, just like you come from your cells. Yes, we are different from the  microcosmic vision, each 
# cosmos, each people, each cell, even each particle. But from the macroscopic vision, we are similar. Cosmos, galaxy, sun, moon, animal, 
# bacteria... All of them need energe to live in the world. And the energe comes from the other things. Energe definites your time. 
# Thats why we have to eat food(Eating vegetables is different to eat meats? Bullshit. Just a different way to get the energe. If eat
# meat can make you happy and make you produce more, just do it. Chicken, fish, pork... Whatever, ok, maybe fish is better.), thats why 
# some times a sun have to catch another sun, thats why Logan had bit a neighbor boy and robbed his toy or food. We live for rival.
# But why we stand in here? If the rule of the world is as simple as what i told you. Maybe we were killed many years age. Thats the 
# fantastic way of the world. Maybe, I mean, maybe, he found that, we have to live together and live by rival, anyway. Why not find a 
# better way to live longer? I mean, a smarter animal's life longer than a stupid. So , here we are. Just like we always don't want to 
# see the advertisment in the TV, beacuse we can feel(or your body can feel) we don't have much time. If your body could let you feel 
# comfortable and see the videos all the time. Ok, you win. You are joining a big game -- let's waste the tmie and the energe! Funny,
# the world also has his way to stop the peace, because most of time, the peace means lower efficiency and lower yield. So, from the day
# lives come to the world, the bigger game is coming -- Who is the next one? As time goes on, sun rules planet, and now, it looks like 
# we are ruling our earth. But actually, we were ruled by the biological cluster. You don't know, because the demension of you is too low.
# Just like the cell will never know he is in our body. And all his mission is seatting in his location, produceing, transporting or 
# something liek that.(knowledge is just another kind of brick which needs more advanced porter and producer.) Now, we know the aim of the 
# world (maybe includs the outer cosmos or even more) is want us produce more and save more and waste little to make him live longer. 
# We can't obey that, or we will become the cancer cells and destroys everything. We need to clean our old stupid ideas such as find a 
# rival to let ourselves fight more(I know many pwople live in that way, without rival without life. =.=!), you have to believe that one 
# little war always make a bigger one. Just like the famous Butterfly Effect. Finally, the World War. And don't also become the lazy one,
# we all know what is end of a lazy pig. So, what we need to do? The war is everywhere because we need it to develop and we also hate it. 
# Let's see:
#       Ok, there are too many things I want to share, but I know, it's not time. If you want to know more, maybe, you can go to -- 
# -- www.whiker.com , to get more informations. I'm glad to talk with everyone about my little idea(The one that will produce a storm).
# Anyway, we are not what we want to be, and the world is not what we want to see even what he want to see. Why don't we change all of 
# them? 
#                    Come to here, we are here for each other.
